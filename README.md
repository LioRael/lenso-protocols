# Lenso Protocols

This repository owns runtime-neutral protocol tooling and portable conformance
artifacts for Lenso. It does not own the Kernel, host runtimes, product
Capabilities, or Plugin implementations.

The source was extracted from `LioRael/lenso` at monorepo commit
`67d21499548d07e92c2f6529d7c8345e58c067d9` under ADR 0064. Imported subtrees
retain their relevant Git history.

## Packages

- `lenso-contract-codegen`: generates Rust and TypeScript bindings from a
  runtime-neutral Capability descriptor.
- `lenso-contract-runtime`: provides the small, platform-neutral wire primitive,
  serde, and portable JSON surface shared by generated Rust bindings.
- `@lenso/contract-runtime`: provides the matching dependency-free TypeScript
  wire types, portable JSON behavior, and forward-compatible Domain Error
  decoding as an npm package.
- `fixtures/portable-contract`: cross-language value-profile conformance data.

Generated bindings retain contract-specific values, Provider traits, Clients,
Endpoints, and operation dispatch. The runtime owns only reusable wire behavior;
patch and minor runtime releases must preserve that behavior, with conformance
tests and generated artifact drift checks guarding both sides of the boundary.

Rust request Providers return `NativeRequestFuture<Operation>` directly. The
generated Endpoint preserves the typed domain/runtime result without wrapping
the Provider future in a second allocation; erased dispatch remains available
only as the compatibility boundary. This Provider signature starts with
`lenso-contract-codegen` 0.4 and requires `lenso-kernel` 0.1.4 or newer.

Generated Rust Clients also implement
`lenso_plugin_authoring::CapabilityClient`. This is the portable seam used by
lifecycle-bound `Port<C>` fields: Plugin glue can connect a whole generated
Client from Plan-owned dependencies without knowing its request, stream, or
Event handle layout. Rust Capability crates generated with this version must
depend on `lenso-plugin-authoring`.

TypeScript bindings also expose a typed Provider interface and a generated
request dispatcher. Runtime packages consume the runtime-neutral
`CapabilityProviderBinding`; Plugin authors implement only their generated
`Provider` alias and register it with `bindProvider`. Decoding, encoding,
Domain Error preservation, unknown Operations, and thrown Plugin failures stay
inside generated contract code instead of leaking into a Bun or Node runtime.

Capability owners generate and check only the language projections they ship.
The original paired form remains available for packages that intentionally own
both artifacts:

```sh
lenso-contract-codegen generate capability.json --rust src/generated.rs
lenso-contract-codegen check capability.json --rust src/generated.rs

lenso-contract-codegen generate capability.json --typescript src/capability.ts
lenso-contract-codegen check capability.json --typescript src/capability.ts

lenso-contract-codegen generate capability.json src/generated.rs generated/bindings.ts
```

## Validation

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --locked --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --locked --workspace
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
bun run typecheck
bun run package-smoke
bun run test
npm pack --dry-run ./packages/lenso-contract-runtime
```
